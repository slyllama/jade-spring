# Seitung Spring Clean

Clear Dragonvoid blights, pick weeds, and utilise your jade bot technologies to decorate a house and garden in this tiny, cozy Guild Wars 2 fan game, set in the vibrant landscape of Seitung Province!

> Nayos was not easy on us; the force of that Kryptis turret's blast left my plating cracked and my servos crushed and fragmented. Repair and recovery will be a slow process and, as grateful as I am for my jade technicians, it pains me to be away from the Commander for so long. Though perhaps, as I rehabilitate, I too can help build something meaningful.

- Build with decorations inspired by a variety of Guild Wars 2 regions.
- Play minigames to clear infestations featuring unique visual effects.
- Tweak your creation with a robust adjustment system.
- Configure your experience - play without infestations, or on a flat world!
