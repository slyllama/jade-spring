# Jade Spring

Take some time to relax, potter, and decorate in Jade Spring, a small, independent Guild Wars 2 sandbox fan game. Tend your garden as a Xunlai jade bot, clearing weeds and pests, dispelling Dragonvoid blights, and furnishing your plot with architecture, flora, furniture, and ornaments from across Tyria!

- __Zen cleaning__ - engage in mini-games to spruce up your garden, clearing out bugs, invasive plants, trash, and leftover strands of Dragonvoid. Collect Karma from each task to spend on permanent improvements to your gardening and decorating abilities!
- __Granular decoration__ - personalise your garden using robust tools which let you easily move, rotate, scale, snap, and clear items. Acquire enough Karma to unlock the Decoration Manager, allowing you to clear items by type, change the time of day, and otherwise adjust the garden at a broad scale.
- __A Guild Wars 2 tribute__ - Jade Spring is an independent developerâ€™s love letter to Cantha and to Guild Wars 2 in general, featuring hand-made art, models, animations, and music directly inspired by the worlds of Tyria.
